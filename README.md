# Python-math
Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perfom mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Built-in Math Functions
The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

Example:

    x = min(5, 10, 25)
    y = max(5, 10, 25)

    print(x)
    print(y)


The abs() functions returns the absoluate (positive) value of the specified number:

Example:

    x = abs(-7.25)

    print(x)


The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y ( y^y).

Example:

Returns the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):

    x = pow(4, 3)

    print(x)

# The Math Module
Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

T use it, you must import the math module:

    import math

When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module. 

The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

Example:

    import math

    x = math.sqrt(64)

    print(x)

# The math.ceil() method rounds  number upwards to its nearest integer, and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

Example:

    import math

    x = math.ceil(1.4)
    y = math.floor(1.4)

    print(x)   # returns 2
    print(y))  # returns 1

The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):

Example:

    import math

    x = math.pi

    print(x)
