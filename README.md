# Python-math
Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perfom mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Built-in Math Functions
The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

Example:

    x = min(5, 10, 25)
    y = max(5, 10, 25)

    print(x)
    print(y)
